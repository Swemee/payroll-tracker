# <Payroll-Tracker>

## Description

This tracker enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data.
Through prompts initiated by the user and then filled out by the user, the tracker then takes that information and puts it on screen.
In the console for the website the tracker also logs the average salary for all employees logged, and chooses one of them at random.
